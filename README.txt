RNN_notebook.ipynb - Our jupyter notebook for running and showing the results of our RNN model
CNN_notebook.ipynb - Our jupyter notebook for running and showing the results of our RNN model
language_dataset.cvs - our first training dataset that is made up of 1000 of the most common word in each of the 5 real languages with stopwords removed plus the entire dataset for Simlish and Elvish
language_dataset_with_stopwords.cvs - similar to the language_dataset.csv but with stopwords included
Difficult_set.cvs - similar to language_dataset_with_stopwords.cvs but with the top 50 most difficult words in each of the 5 real language include and with duplicates across languages removed
test_data_v1.cvs - our test data set that is created by pulling random words from each language; used against all training datasets and classifiers
char2vec_Edward.py - a tutorial that we followed to try to get char2vec to work on our problem but was ultimately scrapped
baseline_classifier.py - naiive bayes and logistical regression classifier that we experimented with, ended up being discarded
